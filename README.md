# P2MP-FTP
Developed a system using P2MP-FTP which transfers files from a single sender to multiple receivers by implementing reliable data transfer over the UDP connection.


Project Description:

Implement point-to-multipoint reliable data transfer protocol using the Stop-and-Wait automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme, and you will carry out a number of experiments to evaluate its performance. In the process I expect that you will develop a good understanding of ARQ schemes and reliable data transfer protocols and build a number of fundamental skills related to writing transport layer services, including:

• encapsulating application data into transport layer segments by including transport headers,

• buffering and managing data received from, or to be delivered to, multiple destinations,

• managing the window size at the sender,

• computing checksums, and

• using the UDP socket interface.
